    <h1>The Scentora Story</h1>
    <p>
      Born from a passion for <strong>timeless elegance</strong>, Scentora redefines luxury perfumery. 
      Each fragrance is a masterpiece, blending rare ingredients with modern artistry to create 
      scents that linger like cherished memories.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our founder, <strong>Isabelle Laurent</strong>, transformed her family's Grasse perfumery heritage 
      into a contemporary vision. "True luxury," she believes, "should whisper to the soul." 
      This philosophy infuses every Scentora creation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We journey across continents to source <strong>exceptional ingredients</strong> - from midnight 
      jasmine in India to aged sandalwood in Mysore. Our sustainable practices ensure these 
      treasures endure for generations to come.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Whether you seek the <strong>bold intensity</strong> of our Noir Essence collection, the 
      <strong>luminous freshness</strong> of our Éclat series, or the <strong>unforgettable romance</strong> of 
      Heritage blends, we invite you to discover your signature scent.
